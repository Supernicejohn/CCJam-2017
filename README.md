# CCJam-2017
LNS is a (now) basic text editor, perhaps the spiritual succesor to my last year's attempt.
Not very impressive at all, maybe without other things in life getting in the way I could've made it better, but oh well haha :)

Features:
Opening a file: LNS <name>
Saving: ctrl+s, or ctrl+shift+s to rename and save
New file: ctrl+n
Undo: ctrl+z
Moving: arrowkeys, scrolling and clicking with mouse



Tested on CraftOS 1.8 but should work under other versions too.

Things left to implement:
Highlighting
Tabs (multiple texts)
Scrollbars (bottom+right)

My apologies to the spirit of your free time xP
